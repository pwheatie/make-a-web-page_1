   <h1>Key Concepts Into to Programming</h1>
   <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Lesson One: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
   </div>
      <div class="concept">
         <h3>World Wide Web</h3>
         <p>It is a system of interconnected public web pages accessible through the Internet. The links between pages make it web like. Major pieces of the World Wide Web (WWW, W3, the Web) include your <em>computer, the Internet, and servers</em>. Requests
            are sent by computers through the Internet, those request get filled by servers that send the information back to the computer and use a browser to display the requested page</p>
        </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It is structured with elements. Elements are created with opening and                closing tags. Each element is created with opening and closing tags: &lt; &gt;. You can provide additional
           functionality and information with attributes. Attributes have values that increase the power and flexibility of HTML. This is            an example of an element with an attribute:
            <!--used html encoder to display actual line of code in the browser without browser running the code-->
            <b>
            &lt;p class=&quot;nice&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;.
            </b> As you can see, between the opening and closing tags we have provided assigned the class <strong>nice</strong> and added the text             <strong>Hello World</strong>.
         </p>
      </div>


      <div class="concept">
         <h3>Why Computers Are A Bit Dense</h3>
         <p>Computers interpret code literally. So any mistakes in code large or small can cause major problems in a program.</p>
      </div>
      
   <div class="lesson">
      <h2> Lesson Two: HTML and The Structured Document</h2>
   </div>
      <div class="concept">
         <h3>Treelike Structure of HTML</h3>
         <p>A web page coded with HTML can be represented by a tree structure or tree diagram. While these representations are really                 <em>upside</em> down trees, they are helpful in illustrating the nested structure used with HTML. This <a href=
            "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> entry gives a good breakdown of tree diagrams.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
      <h3>White Space</h3>
      <p>White space is critical for a properly designed web page. Since HTML will line up one element after another, a proper web designer must use white space to break up elements so the page is readable and aesthetically pleasant. A great video on the
         importance of whitespace can be seen <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48666064/m-48678767"><strong>here</strong></a>. There are several great tools devleopers can use to create whitespace on a web page. In-line elements
         like <em>span</em> can be replaced with block elements like <em>div</em> to create whitespace. In fact, most of an Html page is organized by <strong><em>boxifying</em></strong> content. This allows developers to space the boxed content in a ways that are
         aesthetically pleasing.
      </p>

      <div class="lesson">
        <h2> Lesson Three: Color & Flair With CSS </h2></div>
          <div class="concept">
            <h3> CSS Allows You To Add Style In Various Ways</h3>
            <p>You can style to your webpage using CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. CSS allows web designers to separate the structure of                  the page from the styling. Styling can be added using four different techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Default style of the browser</li>
                  <li>Stylesheet in a separate file(what you usually use)</li>
                  <li>Stylesheet inside the HTML(this can be used for small projects)</li>
                  <li>Inline style in an element (this can be done but should be avoided)</li>
                </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="concept">
            <h3>Boxes, Boxes, and more Boxes!</h3>
            <p>One important aspect to remember when designing a web page is that an HTML page is constructed using boxes. Those boxes can hold pictures, text, forms, list, and many other elements of a web page. This can help you in the design process. Splitting up content into boxes and then organizing a layout can both simplify and clean up a design. There are four components to boxes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Margin: margin clears an area around the border and is completely transparent</li>
              <li>Border: goes around the padding and the content, border is inherited from the color property of the box</li>
              <li>Padding: clears an area around the content/space inside of the box that protects the content</li>
              <li>Content: this is the image or text on the website, it is the core, or center of the box</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3>Stop Repeating Yourself!!</h3>
          <p>One of the more powerful concepts about software development is the ability to avoid repetition. You can use CSS to assign rules and classes to HTML tags. This allows you to style large groups of HTML <strong>ONCE</strong> so you don't have to apply styling to each HTML element separately. This saves time, increases efficiency, while helping keep you keep your code clean and readable.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="concept">
            <h3>Code/Test/Refine</h3>
            <p>As you build your design it is important to focus on the HTML first by looking for repeated styles and semantic elements.Once you write your HTML add your CSS by focusing on the largest elements first. Once you have the styling done, fix the small issues. Using developer tools can really help speed up the process.</p>

      <div class="vocab">
      <h2>Basic HTML Vocabulary</h2>
      <div><strong>Tag</strong>- HTML tag is always contained by brackets</div>
      <div><b>Element</b>- and HTML element refers to an opening tag and closing tag with items like attributes and text between the two tags.</div>
      <div><strong>Attribute</strong>- is a property of an HTML element. <em>href</em> is an example.
      </div>
      <div><strong>Boxify</strong>- The process of boxing content in order to increase flexibility and enhance visual presentation.
